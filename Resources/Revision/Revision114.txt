Rule 260:

When you can see well ahead and the road conditions are good, you should:

   - drive at a steady cruising speed which you and your vehicle can handle safely and is within the speed limit
     (see the Speed limits table)
   - keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front and increase the gap on wet or icy roads, or in fog
     (see Rules 126 and 235).

Rule 261:

You MUST NOT exceed 70 mph (112 km/h), or the maximum speed limit permitted for your vehicle. If a lower speed
limit is in force, either permanently or temporarily, at road works for example, you MUST NOT exceed the lower
limit. On some motorways, mandatory motorway signals (which display the speed within a red ring) are used to vary
the maximum speed limit to improve traffic flow. You MUST NOT exceed this speed limit.
