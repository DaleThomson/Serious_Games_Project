Rule 147:

Be considerate. Be careful of and considerate towards all types of road users, especially those requiring extra
care (see Rule 204).

   -you MUST NOT throw anything out of a vehicle; for example, food or food packaging, cigarette ends, cans, paper
    or carrier bags. This can endanger other road users, particularly motorcyclists and cyclists.
   -try to be understanding if other road users cause problems; they may be inexperienced or not know the area well.
   -be patient; remember that anyone can make a mistake.
   -do not allow yourself to become agitated or involved if someone is behaving badly on the road. This will only
    make the situation worse. Pull over, calm down and, when you feel relaxed, continue your journey.
   -slow down and hold back if a road user pulls out into your path at a junction. Allow them to get clear. Do not
    over-react by driving too close behind to intimidate them.
