Rule 63:

Cycle Lanes. These are marked by a white line (which may be broken) along the carriageway (see Rule 140). Keep
within the lane when practicable. When leaving a cycle lane check before pulling out that it is safe to do so and
signal your intention clearly to other road users. Use of cycle lanes is not compulsory and will depend on your
experience and skills, but they can make your journey safer.

Rule 64:

You MUST NOT cycle on a pavement.
Laws HA 1835 sect 72 & R(S)A 1984, sect 129

Rule 65:

Bus Lanes. Most bus lanes may be used by cyclists as indicated on signs. Watch out for people getting on or off a
bus. Be very careful when overtaking a bus or leaving a bus lane as you will be entering a busier traffic flow.
Do not pass between the kerb and a bus when it is at a stop.
