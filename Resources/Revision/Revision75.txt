Rule 167:

DO NOT overtake where you might come into conflict with other road users. For example:

   - approaching or at a road junction on either side of the road
   - where the road narrows
   - when approaching a school crossing patrol
   - between the kerb and a bus or tram when it is at a stop
   - where traffic is queuing at junctions or road works
   - when you would force another road user to swerve or slow down
   - at a level crossing
   - when a road user is indicating right, even if you believe the signal should have been cancelled. Do not take a
     risk; wait for the signal to be cancelled
   - stay behind if you are following a cyclist approaching a roundabout or junction, and you intend to turn left
   - when a tram is standing at a kerbside tram stop and there is no clearly marked passing lane for other traffic.

Rule 168:

Being overtaken. If a driver is trying to overtake you, maintain a steady course and speed, slowing down if
necessary to let the vehicle pass. Never obstruct drivers who wish to pass. Speeding up or driving unpredictably
while someone is overtaking you is dangerous. Drop back to maintain a two-second gap if someone overtakes and pulls
into the gap in front of you.
