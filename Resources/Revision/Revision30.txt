Rule 76:

Full details about the correct procedure at roundabouts are contained in (see Rules 184 to 190). Roundabouts can be
hazardous and should be approached with care.

Rule 77:

You may feel safer walking your cycle round on the pavement or verge. If you decide to ride round keeping to the
left-hand lane you should:

   - be aware that drivers may not easily see you.
   - take extra care when cycling across exits. You may need to signal right to show you are not leaving the
     roundabout.
   - watch out for vehicles crossing your path to leave or join the roundabout.

Rule 78:

Give plenty of room to long vehicles on the roundabout as they need more space to manoeuvre. Do not ride in the
space they need to get round the roundabout. It may be safer to wait until they have cleared the roundabout.
