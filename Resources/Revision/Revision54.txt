Rule 124:

You MUST NOT exceed the maximum speed limits for the road and for your vehicle. The presence of street lights
generally means that there is a 30 mph (48 km/h) speed limit unless otherwise specified.

Rule 125:

The speed limit is the absolute maximum and does not mean it is safe to drive at that speed irrespective of
conditions. Driving at speeds too fast for the road and traffic conditions is dangerous. You should always reduce
your speed when:

   - the road layout or condition presents hazards, such as bends
   - sharing the road with pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders, particularly children, and motorcyclists
   - weather conditions make it safer to do so
   - driving at night as it is more difficult to see other road users.

A speed limit of 30 miles per hour (mph) or 48 kilometres per hour (km/h) usually applies, unless you see signs
showing otherwise.
