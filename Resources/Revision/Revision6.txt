Rule 13:

Routes shared with cyclists. Some cycle tracks run alongside footpaths or pavements, using a segregating feature to
separate cyclists from people on foot. Segregated routes may also incorporate short lengths of tactile paving to
help visually impaired people stay on the correct side. On the pedestrian side this will comprise a series of
flat-topped bars running across the direction of travel (ladder pattern). On the cyclist side the same bars are
orientated in the direction of travel (tramline pattern). Not all routes which are shared with cyclists are
segregated. Take extra care where this is so (see Rule 62.)

Rule 14:

Parked vehicles. If you have to cross between parked vehicles, use the outside edges of the vehicles as if they
were the kerb. Stop there and make sure you can see all around and that the traffic can see you. Make sure there is
a gap between any parked vehicles on the other side, so you can reach the pavement. Never cross the road in front
of, or behind, any vehicle with its engine running, especially a large vehicle, as the driver may not be able to
see you.

Rule 15:

Reversing vehicles. Never cross behind a vehicle which is reversing, showing white reversing lights or sounding a
warning.
