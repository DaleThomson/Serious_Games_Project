Rule 117:

In normal circumstances. The safest way to brake is to do so early and lightly. Brake more firmly as you begin to
stop. Ease the pressure off just before the vehicle comes to rest to avoid a jerky stop.

Rule 118:

In an emergency. Brake immediately. Try to avoid braking so harshly that you lock your wheels. Locked wheels can
lead to loss of control.

Rule 119:

Skids. Skidding is usually caused by the driver braking, accelerating or steering too harshly or driving too fast
for the road conditions. If skidding occurs, remove the cause by releasing the brake pedal fully or easing off the
accelerator. Turn the steering wheel in the direction of the skid. For example, if the rear of the vehicle skids to
the right, steer immediately to the right to recover.
