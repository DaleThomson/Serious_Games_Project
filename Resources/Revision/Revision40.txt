   - you MUST NOT tow more than your licence permits. If you passed a car test after 1 Jan 1997 you are restricted
     on the weight of trailer you can tow
   - you MUST NOT overload your vehicle or trailer. You should not tow a weight greater than that recommended by the
     manufacturer of your vehicle
   - you MUST secure your load and it MUST NOT stick out dangerously. Make sure any heavy or sharp objects and any
     animals are secured safely. If there is a collision, they might hit someone inside the vehicle and cause
     serious injury you should properly distribute the weight in your caravan or trailer with heavy items mainly
     over the axle(s) and ensure a downward load on the tow ball. Manufacturer's recommended weight and tow ball
     load should not be exceeded. This should avoid the possibility of swerving or snaking and going out of control.
     If this does happen, ease off the accelerator and reduce speed gently to regain control

In the event of a breakdown, be aware that towing a vehicle on a tow rope is potentially dangerous. You should
consider professional recovery.
