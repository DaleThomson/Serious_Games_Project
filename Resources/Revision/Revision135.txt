Rule 306:

All road users, but particularly cyclists and motorcyclists, should take extra care when driving or riding close to
or crossing the tracks, especially if the rails are wet. You should take particular care when crossing the rails at
shallow angles, on bends and at junctions. It is safest to cross the tracks directly at right angles. Other road
users should be aware that cyclists and motorcyclists may need more space to cross the tracks safely.

Rule 307:

Overhead electric lines. Tramway overhead wires are normally 5.8 metres above any carriageway, but can be lower.
You should ensure that you have sufficient clearance between the wire and your vehicle (including any load you are
carrying) before driving under an overhead wire. Drivers of vehicles with extending cranes, booms, tipping
apparatus or other types of variable height equipment should ensure that the equipment is fully lowered. Where
overhead wires are set lower than 5.8 metres, these will be indicated by height clearance markings - similar to
‘low bridge’ signs. The height clearances on these plates should be carefully noted and observed. If you are in any
doubt as to whether your vehicle will pass safely under the wires, you should always contact the local police or
the tramway operator. Never take a chance as this can be extremely hazardous.
