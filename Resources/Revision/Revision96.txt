Rule 219:

Emergency and Incident Support vehicles. You should look and listen for ambulances, fire engines, police, doctors or
other emergency vehicles using flashing blue, red or green lights and sirens or flashing headlights, or Highways
Agency Traffic Officer and Incident Support vehicles using flashing amber lights. When one approaches do not panic.
Consider the route of such a vehicle and take appropriate action to let it pass, while complying with all traffic
signs. If necessary, pull to the side of the road and stop, but try to avoid stopping before the brow of a hill,
a bend or narrow section of road. Do not endanger yourself, other road users or pedestrians and avoid mounting the
kerb. Do not brake harshly on approach to a junction or roundabout, as a following vehicle may not have the same view
as you.

Rule 220:

Powered vehicles used by disabled people. These small vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 8 mph (12 km/h). On a
dual carriageway where the speed limit exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h) they MUST have a flashing amber beacon, but on other
roads you may not have that advance warning (see Rules 36 to 46 inclusive).
