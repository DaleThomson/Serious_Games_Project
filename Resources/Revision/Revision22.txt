Rule 58:

Animals being herded. These should be kept under control at all times. You should, if possible, send another person
along the road in front to warn other road users, especially at a bend or the brow of a hill. It is safer not to
move animals after dark, but if you do, then wear reflective clothing and ensure that lights are carried
(white at the front and red at the rear of the herd).

Rule 59:

Clothing. You should wear:

    -a cycle helmet which conforms to current regulations, is the correct size and securely fastened
    -appropriate clothes for cycling. Avoid clothes which may get tangled in the chain, or in a wheel or may obscure
     your lights
    -light-coloured or fluorescent clothing which helps other road users to see you in daylight and poor light
    -reflective clothing and/or accessories (belt, arm or ankle bands) in the dark
