Rule 10:

Tactile paving. Raised surfaces that can be felt underfoot provide warning and guidance to blind or partially
sighted people. The most common surfaces are a series of raised studs, which are used at crossing points with a
dropped kerb, or a series of rounded raised bars which are used at level crossings, at the top and bottom of steps
and at some other hazards.

Rule 11:

One-way streets. Check which way the traffic is moving. Do not cross until it is safe to do so without stopping.
Bus and cycle lanes may operate in the opposite direction to the rest of the traffic.

Rule 12:

Bus and cycle lanes. Take care when crossing these lanes as traffic may be moving faster than in the other lanes,
or against the flow of traffic.
