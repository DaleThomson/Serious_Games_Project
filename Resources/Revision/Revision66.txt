Rule 151:

In slow-moving traffic. You should:

   - reduce the distance between you and the vehicle ahead to maintain traffic flow
   - never get so close to the vehicle in front that you cannot stop safely
   - leave enough space to be able to manoeuvre if the vehicle in front breaks down or an emergency vehicle needs to
     get past
   - not change lanes to the left to overtake
   - allow access into and from side roads, as blocking these will add to congestion
   - be aware of cyclists and motorcyclists who may be passing on either side.

Rule 152:

Residential streets. You should drive slowly and carefully on streets where there are likely to be pedestrians,
cyclists and parked cars. In some areas a 20 mph (32 km/h) maximum speed limit may be in force. Look out for:

   - vehicles emerging from junctions or driveways
   - vehicles moving off
   - car doors opening
   - pedestrians
   - children running out from between parked cars
   - cyclists and motorcyclists.
