Rule 184:

On approaching a roundabout take notice and act on all the information available to you, including traffic signs,
traffic lights and lane markings which direct you into the correct lane. You should:
   - use Mirrors - Signal - Manoeuvre at all stages
   - decide as early as possible which exit you need to take
   - give an appropriate signal (see Rule 186, below). Time your signals so as not to confuse other road users
   - get into the correct lane
   - adjust your speed and position to fit in with traffic conditions
   - be aware of the speed and position of all the road users around you.

Rule 185:

When reaching the roundabout you should:

   - give priority to traffic approaching from your right, unless directed otherwise by signs, road markings or
     traffic lights
   - check whether road markings allow you to enter the roundabout without giving way. If so, proceed, but still look
     to the right before joining
   - watch out for all other road users already on the roundabout; be aware they may not be signalling correctly or at
     all
   - look forward before moving off to make sure traffic in front has moved off.
