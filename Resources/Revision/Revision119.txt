Rule 272:

Unless signs indicate that a lane leads directly off the motorway, you will normally leave the motorway by a slip
road on your left. You should

   -watch for the signs letting you know you are getting near your exit
   -move into the left-hand lane well before reaching your exit
   -signal left in good time and reduce your speed on the slip road as necessary.

Rule 273:

On leaving the motorway or using a link road between motorways, your speed may be higher than you realise - 50 mph
may feel like 30 mph. Check your speedometer and adjust your speed accordingly. Some slip-roads and link roads have
sharp bends, so you will need to slow down.
