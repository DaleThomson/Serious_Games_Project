Rule 160:

Once moving you should:

   - keep to the left, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise. The exceptions are when you want to
     overtake, turn right or pass parked vehicles or pedestrians in the road
   - keep well to the left on right-hand bends. This will improve your view of the road and help avoid the risk of
     colliding with traffic approaching from the opposite direction
   - drive with both hands on the wheel where possible. This will help you to remain in full control of the vehicle
     at all times. You may use driver assistance systems while you are driving. Make sure you use any system
     according to the manufacturer's instructions.
   - be aware of other road users, especially cycles and motorcycles who may be filtering through the traffic. These
     are more difficult to see than larger vehicles and their riders are particularly vulnerable. Give them plenty of 
     room, especially if you are driving a long vehicle or towing a trailer
   - select a lower gear before you reach a long downhill slope. This will help to control your speed
   - when towing, remember the extra length will affect overtaking and manoeuvring. The extra weight will also
     affect the braking and acceleration.
