Rule 19:

Zebra crossings. Give traffic plenty of time to see you and to stop before you start to cross. Vehicles will need
more time when the road is slippery. Wait until traffic has stopped from both directions or the road is clear
before crossing. Remember that traffic does not have to stop until someone has moved onto the crossing. Keep
looking both ways, and listening, in case a driver or rider has not seen you and attempts to overtake a vehicle
that has stopped.

Rule 20:

Where there is an island in the middle of a zebra crossing, wait on the island and follow Rule 19 before you cross
the second half of the road - it is a separate crossing.

Rule 21:

At traffic lights. There may be special signals for pedestrians. You should only start to cross the road when the
green figure shows. If you have started to cross the road and the green figure goes out, you should still have time
to reach the other side, but do not delay. If no pedestrian signals have been provided, watch carefully and do not
cross until the traffic lights are red and the traffic has stopped. Keep looking and check for traffic that may be
turning the corner. Remember that traffic lights may let traffic move in some lanes while traffic in other lanes has
stopped.
