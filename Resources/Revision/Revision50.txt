Rule 115:

You should also

   -use dipped headlights, or dim-dip if fitted, at night in built-up areas and in dull daytime weather, to ensure
    that you can be seen
   -keep your headlights dipped when overtaking until you are level with the other vehicle and then change to main
    beam if necessary, unless this would dazzle oncoming road users
   -slow down, and if necessary stop, if you are dazzled by oncoming headlights

Rule 116:

Hazard warning lights. These may be used when your vehicle is stationary, to warn that it is temporarily obstructing
traffic. Never use them as an excuse for dangerous or illegal parking. You MUST NOT use hazard warning lights while
driving or being towed unless you are on a motorway or unrestricted dual carriageway and you need to warn drivers
behind you of a hazard or obstruction ahead. Only use them for long enough to ensure that your warning has been
observed.
