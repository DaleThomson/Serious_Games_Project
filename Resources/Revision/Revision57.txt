Rule 132:

Reflective road studs may be used with white lines.

   -White studs mark the lanes or the middle of the road.
   -Red studs mark the left edge of the road.
   -Amber studs mark the central reservation of a dual carriageway or motorway.
   -Green studs mark the edge of the main carriageway at lay-bys and slip roads.
   -Green/yellow studs indicate temporary adjustments to lane layouts, e.g. where road works are taking place.

Rule 133:

If you need to change lane, first use your mirrors and if necessary take a quick sideways glance to make sure you
will not force another road user to change course or speed. When it is safe to do so, signal to indicate your
intentions to other road users and when clear, move over.

Rule 134:

You should follow the signs and road markings and get into the lane as directed. In congested road conditions do not
change lanes unnecessarily. Merging in turn is recommended but only if safe and appropriate when vehicles are
travelling at a very low speed, e.g. when approaching road works or a road traffic incident. It is not recommended
at high speed.
