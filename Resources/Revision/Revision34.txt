Rule 87:

Riding in the dark. Wear reflective clothing or strips to improve your visibility in the dark. These reflect light
from the headlamps of other vehicles, making you visible from a longer distance. See Rules 113-116 for lighting
requirements.

Rule 88:

Manoeuvering. You should be aware of what is behind and to the sides before manoeuvring. Look behind you; use
mirrors if they are fitted. When in traffic queues look out for pedestrians crossing between vehicles and vehicles
emerging from junctions or changing lanes. Position yourself so that drivers in front can see you in their mirrors.
Additionally, when filtering in slow-moving traffic, take care and keep your speed low.

Rule 89:

Vehicle condition. You MUST ensure your vehicle and trailer comply with the full requirements of the Road Vehicles
(Construction and Use) Regulations and Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations (see The road user and the law).
