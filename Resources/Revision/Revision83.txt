Rule 186:

Signals and position. When taking the first exit, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise:

   - signal left and approach in the left-hand lane
   - keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signalling left to leave.

When taking an exit to the right or going full circle, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise:

   - signal right and approach in the right-hand lane
   - keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundabout
   - signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want.

When taking any intermediate exit, unless signs or markings indicate otherwise:

   - select the appropriate lane on approach to and on the roundabout
   - you should not normally need to signal on approach
   - stay in this lane until you need to alter course to exit the roundabout
   - signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want.

When there are more than three lanes at the entrance to a roundabout, use the most appropriate lane on approach and
through it.
