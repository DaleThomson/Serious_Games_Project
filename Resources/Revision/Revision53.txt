Rule 122:

Coasting. This term describes a vehicle travelling in neutral or with the clutch pressed down. It can reduce driver
control because:

   - engine braking is eliminated
   - vehicle speed downhill will increase quickly
   - increased use of the footbrake can reduce its effectiveness
   - steering response will be affected, particularly on bends and corners
   - it may be more difficult to select the appropriate gear when needed.

Rule 123:

You MUST NOT leave a parked vehicle unattended with the engine running or leave a vehicle engine running
unnecessarily while that vehicle is stationary on a public road. Generally, if the vehicle is stationary and is
likely to remain so for more than a couple of minutes, you should apply the parking brake and switch off the engine
to reduce emissions and noise pollution. However it is permissible to leave the engine running if the vehicle is
stationary in traffic or for diagnosing faults.
