Rule 207:

Particularly vulnerable pedestrians. These include:

   - children and older pedestrians who may not be able to judge your speed and could step into the road in front of
     you. At 40 mph (64 km/h) your vehicle will probably kill any pedestrians it hits. At 20 mph (32 km/h) there is
     only a 1 in 20 chance of the pedestrian being killed. So kill your speed
   - older pedestrians who may need more time to cross the road. Be patient and allow them to cross in their own time.
     Do not hurry them by revving your engine or edging forward
   - people with disabilities. People with hearing impairments may not be aware of your vehicle approaching. Those
     with walking difficulties require more time
   - blind or partially sighted people, who may be carrying a white cane using a guide dog. They may not be able to
     see you approaching
   - deafblind people who may be carrying a white cane with a red band or using a dog with a red and white harness.
     They may not see or hear instructions or signals.

Rule 208:

Near schools. Drive slowly and be particularly aware of young cyclists and pedestrians. In some places, there may be
a flashing amber signal below the ‘School’ warning sign which tells you that there may be children crossing the road
ahead. Drive very slowly until you are clear of the area.
