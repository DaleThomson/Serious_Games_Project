Rule 55:

Avoid roundabouts wherever possible. If you use them you should - keep to the left and watch out for vehicles
crossing your path to leave or join the roundabout - signal right when riding across exits to show you are not
leaving - signal left just before you leave the roundabout.

Rule 56:

Dogs. Do not let a dog out on the road on its own. Keep it on a short lead when walking on the pavement, road or
path shared with cyclists or horse riders.

Rule 57:

When in a vehicle make sure dogs or other animals are suitably restrained so they cannot distract you while you are
driving or injure you, or themselves, if you stop quickly. A seat belt harness, pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard
are ways of restraining animals in cars.
