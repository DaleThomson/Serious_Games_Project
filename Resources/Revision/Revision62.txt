Rule 146:

Adapt your driving to the appropriate type and condition of road you are on. In particular

   -do not treat speed limits as a target. It is often not appropriate or safe to drive at the maximum speed limit
   -take the road and traffic conditions into account. Be prepared for unexpected or difficult situations, for
    example, the road being blocked beyond a blind bend. Be prepared to adjust your speed as a precaution
   -where there are junctions, be prepared for road users emerging
   -in side roads and country lanes look out for unmarked junctions where nobody has priority
   -be prepared to stop at traffic control systems, road works, pedestrian crossings or traffic lights as necessary
   -try to anticipate what pedestrians and cyclists might do. If pedestrians, particularly children, are looking
    the other way, they may step out into the road without seeing you.
