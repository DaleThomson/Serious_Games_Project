Rule 120:

ABS. If your vehicle is fitted with anti-lock brakes, you should follow the advice given in the vehicle handbook.
However, in the case of an emergency, apply the footbrake firmly; do not release the pressure until the vehicle has
slowed to the desired speed. The ABS should ensure that steering control will be retained, but do not assume that a
vehicle with ABS will stop in a shorter distance.

Rule 121:

Brakes affected by water. If you have driven through deep water your brakes may be less effective. Test them at the
first safe opportunity by pushing gently on the brake pedal to make sure that they work. If they are not fully
effective, gently apply light pressure while driving slowly. This will help to dry them out.
