Rule 275:

If your vehicle develops a problem, leave the motorway at the next exit or pull into a service area. If you cannot
do so, you should:

   - pull on to the hard shoulder and stop as far to the left as possible, with your wheels turned to the left
   - try to stop near an emergency telephone (situated at approximately one-mile intervals along the hard shoulder)
   - leave the vehicle by the left-hand door and ensure your passengers do the same. You MUST leave any animals in
     the vehicle or, in an emergency, keep them under proper control on the verge. Never attempt to place a warning
     triangle on a motorway
   - do not put yourself in danger by attempting even simple repairs
   - ensure that passengers keep away from the carriageway and hard shoulder, and that children are kept under 
     control
   - walk to an emergency telephone on your side of the carriageway (follow the arrows on the posts at the back of
     the hard shoulder) - the telephone is free of charge and connects directly to the Highways Agency or the police.
     Use these in preference to a mobile phone (see Rule 283). Always face the traffic when you speak on the phone
   - give full details to the Highways Agency or the police; also inform them if you are a vulnerable motorist such
     as disabled, older or travelling alone
   - return and wait near your vehicle (well away from the carriageway and hard shoulder)
   - if you feel at risk from another person, return to your vehicle by a left-hand door and lock all doors. Leave
     your vehicle again as soon as you feel this danger has passed.
