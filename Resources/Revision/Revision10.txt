Rule 25:

Toucan crossings are light-controlled crossings which allow cyclists and pedestrians to share crossing space and
cross at the same time. They are push-button operated. Pedestrians and cyclists will see the green signal together.
Cyclists are permitted to ride across.

Rule 26:

At some crossings there is a bleeping sound or voice signal to indicate to blind or partially sighted people when
the steady green figure is showing, and there may be a tactile signal to help deafblind people.

Rule 27:

Equestrian crossings are for horse riders. They have pavement barriers, wider crossing spaces, horse and rider
figures in the light panels and either two sets of controls (one higher), or just one higher control panel.
