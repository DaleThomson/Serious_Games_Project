Rule 239:

Use off-street parking areas, or bays marked out with white lines on the road as parking places, wherever possible.
If you have to stop on the roadside:

   - do not park facing against the traffic flow
   - stop as close as you can to the side
   - do not stop too close to a vehicle displaying a Blue Badge: remember, the occupant may need more room to get in
     or out
   - you MUST switch off the engine, headlights and fog lights
   - you MUST apply the handbrake before leaving the vehicle
   - you MUST ensure you do not hit anyone when you open your door. Check for cyclists or other traffic
   - it is safer for your passengers (especially children) to get out of the vehicle on the side next to the kerb
   - put all valuables out of sight and make sure your vehicle is secure
   - lock your vehicle.

Before using a hand-held device to help you to park, you MUST make sure it is safe to do so. Then, you should move
the vehicle into the parking space in the safest way, and by the shortest route possible.

When you use a hand-held device to help you to park, you MUST remain in control of the vehicle at all times. Do not
use the hand-held device for anything else while you are using it to help you park, and do not put anyone in danger. 
Use the hand-held device according to the manufacturer's instructions.
