Rule 43:

You MUST follow the same rules about using lights, indicators and horns as for other road vehicles, if your vehicle
is fitted with them. At night, lights MUST be used. Be aware that other road users may not see you and you should
make yourself more visible - even in the daytime and also at dusk - by, for instance, wearing a reflective jacket
or reflective strips on the back of the vehicle.

Rule 44:

Take extra care at road junctions. When going straight ahead, check to make sure there are no vehicles about to
cross your path from the left, the right, or overtaking you and turning left. There are several options for dealing
with right turns, especially turning from a major road. If moving into the middle of the road is difficult or
dangerous, you can - stop on the left-hand side of the road and wait for a safe gap in the traffic - negotiate the
turn as a pedestrian, i.e. travel along the pavement and cross the road between pavements where it is safe to do
so. Class 3 users should switch the vehicle to the lower speed limit when on pavements.

If the junction is too hazardous, it may be worth considering an alternative route. Similarly, when negotiating
major roundabouts (i.e. with two or more lanes) it may be safer for you to use the pavement or find a route which
avoids the roundabout altogether.
