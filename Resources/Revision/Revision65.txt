Rule 149:

You MUST exercise proper control of your vehicle at all times. You MUST NOT use a hand-held mobile phone, or
similar device, when driving or when supervising a learner driver, except to call 999 or 112 in a genuine emergency
when it is unsafe or impractical to stop. Never use a hand-held microphone when driving. Using hands-free equipment
is also likely to distract your attention from the road. It is far safer not to use any telephone while you are
driving or riding - find a safe place to stop first or use the voicemail facility and listen to messages later.

You may park your vehicle using a hand-held remote control app or device. The app or device MUST be legal, and you
should not put other people in danger when you use it.

Rule 150:

There is a danger of driver distraction being caused by in-vehicle systems such as satellite navigation systems,
congestion warning systems, PCs, multi-media, etc. You MUST exercise proper control of your vehicle at all times.
Do not rely on driver assistance systems such as cruise control or lane departure warnings. They are available to
assist but you should not reduce your concentration levels. Do not be distracted by maps or screen-based information
(such as navigation or vehicle management systems) while driving or riding. If necessary find a safe place to stop.

As the driver, you are still responsible for the vehicle if you use a driver assistance system
(like motorway assist). This is also the case if you use a hand-held remote control parking app or device.
You MUST have full control over these systems at all times.
