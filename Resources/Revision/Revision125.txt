Rule 284:

Vehicles carrying dangerous goods in packages will be marked with plain orange reflective plates. Road tankers and
vehicles carrying tank containers of dangerous goods will have hazard warning plates.

Rule 285:

If an incident involves a vehicle containing dangerous goods, follow the advice in Rule 283 and, in particular:

   - switch off engines and DO NOT SMOKE
   - keep well away from the vehicle and do not be tempted to try to rescue casualties as you yourself could become
     one
   - call the emergency services and give as much information as possible about the labels and markings on the
     vehicle. DO NOT use a mobile phone close to a vehicle carrying flammable loads.
