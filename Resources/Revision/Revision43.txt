Rule 103:

Signals warn and inform other road users, including pedestrians (download ‘Signals to other road users’), of your
intended actions. You should always:

   -give clear signals in plenty of time, having checked it is not misleading to signal at that time
   -use them to advise other road users before changing course or direction, stopping or moving off
   -cancel them after use
   -make sure your signals will not confuse others. If, for instance, you want to stop after a side road, do not
    signal until you are passing the road. If you signal earlier it may give the impression that you intend to turn
    into the road. Your brake lights will warn traffic behind you that you are slowing down
   -use an arm signal to emphasise or reinforce your signal if necessary. Remember that signalling does not give
    you priority.

Rule 104:

You should also

    watch out for signals given by other road users and proceed only when you are satisfied that it is safe
    be aware that an indicator on another vehicle may not have been cancelled.
