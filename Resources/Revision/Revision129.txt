Rule 291:

A level crossing is where a road crosses a railway or tramway line. Approach and cross it with care. Never drive
onto a crossing until the road is clear on the other side and do not get too close to the car in front. Never stop 
or park on, or near, a crossing.

Rule 292:

It is dangerous to touch overhead electric lines. You MUST obey the safe height warning road signs and you should
not continue forward onto the railway if your vehicle touches any height barrier or bells. The clearance available
is usually 5 metres (16 feet 6 inches) but may be lower.
