Rule 209:

Drive carefully and slowly when passing a stationary bus showing a 'School Bus' sign as children may be getting on or
off.

Rule 210:

You MUST stop when a school crossing patrol shows a 'Stop for children' sign.

Rule 211:

It is often difficult to see motorcyclists and cyclists, especially when they are coming up from behind, coming out of
junctions, at roundabouts, overtaking you or filtering through traffic. Always look out for them before you emerge
from a junction; they could be approaching faster than you think. When turning right across a line of slow-moving or
stationary traffic, look out for cyclists or motorcyclists on the inside of the traffic you are crossing.
Be especially careful when turning, and when changing direction or lane. Be sure to check mirrors and blind spots
carefully.

Rule 212:

When passing motorcyclists and cyclists, give them plenty of room (see Rules 162 to 167). If they look over their
shoulder it could mean that they intend to pull out, turn right or change direction. Give them time and space to do
so.
