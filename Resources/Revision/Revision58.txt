Rule 135:

Where a single carriageway has three lanes and the road markings or signs do not give priority to traffic in either
direction

   -use the middle lane only for overtaking or turning right. Remember, you have no more right to use the middle
    lane than a driver coming from the opposite direction
   -do not use the right-hand lane.

Rule 136:

Where a single carriageway has four or more lanes, use only the lanes that signs or markings indicate.

On a two-lane dual carriageway you should stay in the left-hand lane. Use the right-hand lane for overtaking or
turning right. After overtaking, move back to the left-hand lane when it is safe to do so.

Rule 138:

On a three-lane dual carriageway, you may use the middle lane or the right-hand lane to overtake but return to the
middle and then the left-hand lane when it is safe.
