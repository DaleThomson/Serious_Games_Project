Rule 187:

In all cases watch out for and give plenty of room to

   -pedestrians who may be crossing the approach and exit roads
   -traffic crossing in front of you on the roundabout, especially vehicles intending to leave by the next exit
   -traffic which may be straddling lanes or positioned incorrectly
   -motorcyclists
   -cyclists and horse riders who may stay in the left-hand lane and signal right if they intend to continue round
    the roundabout. Allow them to do so
   -long vehicles (including those towing trailers). These might have to take a different course or straddle lanes
    either approaching or on the roundabout because of their length. Watch out for their signals.

Rule 188:

Mini-roundabouts. Approach these in the same way as normal roundabouts. All vehicles MUST pass round the central
markings except large vehicles which are physically incapable of doing so. Remember, there is less space to manoeuvre
and less time to signal. Avoid making U-turns at mini-roundabouts. Beware of others doing this.
