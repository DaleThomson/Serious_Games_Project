Rule 31:

Emergency vehicles. If an ambulance, fire engine, police or other emergency vehicle approaches using flashing blue
lights, headlights and/or sirens, keep off the road.

Rule 32:

Buses. Get on or off a bus only when it has stopped to allow you to do so. Watch out for cyclists when you are
getting off. Never cross the road directly behind or in front of a bus. Wait until it has moved off and you can
see clearly in both directions.

Rule 33:

Tramways. These may run through pedestrian areas. Their path will be marked out by shallow kerbs, changes in the
paving or other road surface, white lines or yellow dots. Cross at designated crossings where provided. Elsewhere
treat trams as you would other road vehicles and look both ways along the track before crossing. Do not walk along
the track as trams may come up behind you. Trams move quietly and cannot steer to avoid you.
