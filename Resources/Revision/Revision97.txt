Rule 220:

Powered vehicles used by disabled people. These small vehicles travel at a maximum speed of 8 mph (12 km/h). On a
dual carriageway where the speed limit exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h) they MUST have a flashing amber beacon, but on other
roads you may not have that advance warning (see Rules 36 to 46 inclusive).

Law RVLR reg 17(1) & 26

Rule 221:

Large vehicles. These may need extra road space to turn or to deal with a hazard that you are not able to see. If you
are following a large vehicle, such as a bus or articulated lorry, be aware that the driver may not be able to see
you in the mirrors. Be prepared to stop and wait if it needs room or time to turn.

Rule 222:

Large vehicles can block your view. Your ability to see and to plan ahead will be improved if you pull back to
increase your separation distance. Be patient, as larger vehicles are subject to lower speed limits than cars and
motorcycles. Many large vehicles may be fitted with speed limiting devices which will restrict speed to 56 mph
(90 km/h) even on a motorway.
