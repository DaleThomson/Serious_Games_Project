Rule 300:

You MUST NOT enter a road, lane or other route reserved for trams. Take extra care where trams run along the road.
You should avoid driving directly on top of the rails and should take care where trams leave the main carriageway
to enter the reserved route, to ensure you do not follow them. The width taken up by trams is often shown by tram
lanes marked by white lines, yellow dots or by a different type of road surface. Diamond-shaped signs and white
light signals give instructions to tram drivers only.

Rule 301:

Take extra care where the track crosses from one side of the road to the other and where the road narrows and the
tracks come close to the kerb. Tram drivers usually have their own traffic signals and may be permitted to move
when you are not. Always give way to trams. Do not try to race or overtake them or pass them on the inside, unless
they are at tram stops or stopped by tram signals and there is a designated tram lane for you to pass.

Rule 302:

You MUST NOT park your vehicle where it would get in the way of trams or where it would force other drivers to do so.
Do not stop on any part of a tram track, except in a designated bay where this has been provided alongside and clear
of the track. When doing so, ensure that all parts of your vehicle are outside the delineated tram path. Remember
that a tram cannot steer round an obstruction.
