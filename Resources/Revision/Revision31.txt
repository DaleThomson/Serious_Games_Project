Rule 79:

Do not ride across equestrian crossings, as they are for horse riders only. Do not ride across a pelican, puffin or
zebra crossing. Dismount and wheel your cycle across.

Rule 80:

Toucan crossings. These are light-controlled crossings which allow cyclists and pedestrians to share crossing space
and cross at the same time. They are push-button operated. Pedestrians and cyclists will see the green signal
together. Cyclists are permitted to ride across.

Rule 81:

Cycle-only crossings. Cycle tracks on opposite sides of the road may be linked by signalled crossings. You may ride
across but you MUST NOT cross until the green cycle symbol is showing.
