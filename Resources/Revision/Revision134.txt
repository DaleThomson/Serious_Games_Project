Rule 303:

Tram stops. Where the tram stops at a platform, either in the middle or at the side of the road, you MUST follow
the route shown by the road signs and markings. At stops without platforms you MUST NOT drive between a tram and
the left-hand kerb when a tram has stopped to pick up passengers. If there is no alternative route signed, do not
overtake the tram - wait until it moves off. 
Law RTRA sects 5 & 8

Rule 304:

Look out for pedestrians, especially children, running to catch a tram approaching a stop.

Rule 305:

Always give priority to trams, especially when they signal to pull away from stops, unless it would be unsafe to do
so. Remember that they may be carrying large numbers of standing passengers who could be injured if the tram had to
make an emergency stop. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road.
