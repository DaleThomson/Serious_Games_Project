Rule 179:

Well before you turn right you should:

   - use your mirrors to make sure you know the position and movement of traffic behind you
   - give a right-turn signal
   - take up a position just left of the middle of the road or in the space marked for traffic turning right
   - leave room for other vehicles to pass on the left, if possible.

Rule 180:

Wait until there is a safe gap between you and any oncoming vehicle. Watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists,
pedestrians and other road users. Check your mirrors and blind spot again to make sure you are not being overtaken,
then make the turn. Do not cut the corner. Take great care when turning into a main road; you will need to watch for
traffic in both directions and wait for a safe gap.

Remember: Mirrors - Signal - Manoeuvre
