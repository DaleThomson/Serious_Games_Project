Rule 1:

Pavements (including any path along the side of a road) should be used if provided. Where possible, avoid being
next to the kerb with your back to the traffic. If you have to step into the road, look both ways first. Always
show due care and consideration for others.

Rule 2:

If there is no pavement, keep to the right-hand side of the road so that you can see oncoming traffic. You should
take extra care and:

    - be prepared to walk in single file, especially on narrow roads or in poor light
    - keep close to the side of the road.

It may be safer to cross the road well before a sharp right-hand bend so that oncoming traffic has a better chance
of seeing you. Cross back after the bend.

Rule 3:

Help other road users to see you. Wear or carry something light-coloured, bright or fluorescent in poor daylight
conditions. When it is dark, use reflective materials (e.g. armbands, sashes, waistcoats, jackets, footwear), 
which can be seen by drivers using headlights up to three times as far away as non-reflective materials.
