Rule 206:

Drive carefully and slowly when

   -in crowded shopping streets, Home Zones and Quiet Lanes (see Rule 218) or residential areas
   -driving past bus and tram stops; pedestrians may emerge suddenly into the road
   -passing parked vehicles, especially ice cream vans; children are more interested in ice cream than traffic and
    may run into the road unexpectedly
   -needing to cross a pavement or cycle track; for example, to reach or leave a driveway. Give way to pedestrians
    and cyclists on the pavement
   -reversing into a side road; look all around the vehicle and give way to any pedestrians who may be crossing the
    road
   -turning at road junctions; give way to pedestrians who are already crossing the road into which you are turning
   -the pavement is closed due to street repairs and pedestrians are directed to use the road
   -approaching pedestrians on narrow rural roads without a footway or footpath. Always slow down and be prepared to
    stop if necessary, giving them plenty of room as you drive past.
