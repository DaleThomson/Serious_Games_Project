Rule 181:

When turning right at crossroads where an oncoming vehicle is also turning right, there is a choice of two methods

   -turn right side to right side; keep the other vehicle on your right and turn behind it. This is generally the
    safer method as you have a clear view of any approaching traffic when completing your turn
   -left side to left side, turning in front of each other. This can block your view of oncoming vehicles, so take
    extra care. Cyclists and motorcyclists in particular may be hidden from your view. Road layout, markings or how
    the other vehicle is positioned can determine which course should be taken.

Rule 182:

Use your mirrors and give a left-turn signal well before you turn left. Do not overtake just before you turn left and
watch out for traffic coming up on your left before you make the turn, especially if driving a large vehicle.
Cyclists, motorcyclists and other road users in particular may be hidden from your view.

Rule 183:

When turning

   -keep as close to the left as is safe and practicable
   -give way to any vehicles using a bus lane, cycle lane or tramway from either direction.
