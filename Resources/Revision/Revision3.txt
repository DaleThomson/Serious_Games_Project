Rule 7:

The Green Cross Code. The advice given below on crossing the road is for all pedestrians. Children should be taught
the Code and should not be allowed out alone until they can understand and use it properly. The age when they can
do this is different for each child. Many children cannot judge how fast vehicles are going or how far away they
are. Children learn by example, so parents and carers should always use the Code in full when out with their
children. They are responsible for deciding at what age children can use it safely by themselves.

A. First find a safe place to cross and where there is space to reach the pavement on the other side. Where there
is a crossing nearby, use it. It is safer to cross using a subway, a footbridge, an island, a zebra, pelican,
toucan or puffin crossing, or where there is a crossing point controlled by a police officer, a school crossing
patrol or a traffic warden. Otherwise choose a place where you can see clearly in all directions. Try to avoid
crossing between parked cars (see Rule 14), on a blind bend, or close to the brow of a hill. Move to a space where
drivers and riders can see you clearly. Do not cross the road diagonally.

B. Stop just before you get to the kerb, where you can see if anything is coming. Do not get too close to the 
traffic. If there's no pavement, keep back from the edge of the road but make sure you can still see approaching 
traffic.

C. Look all around for traffic and listen. Traffic could come from any direction. Listen as well, because you can
sometimes hear traffic before you see it.
