Rule 213:

Motorcyclists and cyclists may suddenly need to avoid uneven road surfaces and obstacles such as drain covers or oily,
wet or icy patches on the road. Give them plenty of room and pay particular attention to any sudden change of
direction they may have to make.

Rule 214:

Animals. When passing animals, drive slowly. Give them plenty of room and be ready to stop. Do not scare animals by
sounding your horn, revving your engine or accelerating rapidly once you have passed them. Look out for animals
being led, driven or ridden on the road and take extra care. Keep your speed down at bends and on narrow country
roads. If a road is blocked by a herd of animals, stop and switch off your engine until they have left the road.
Watch out for animals on unfenced roads.

Rule 215:

Horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles. Be particularly careful of horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles especially
when overtaking. Always pass wide and slowly. Horse riders are often children, so take extra care and remember riders
may ride in double file when escorting a young or inexperienced horse or rider. Look out for horse riders’ and horse
drivers’ signals and heed a request to slow down or stop. Take great care and treat all horses as a potential hazard.
