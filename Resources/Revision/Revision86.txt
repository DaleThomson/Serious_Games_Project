Rule 194:

Allow pedestrians plenty of time to cross and do not harass them by revving your engine or edging forward.

Rule 195:

Zebra crossings. As you approach a zebra crossing:

   - look out for pedestrians waiting to cross and be ready to slow down or stop to let them cross
   - you MUST give way when a pedestrian has moved onto a crossing
   - allow more time for stopping on wet or icy roads
   - do not wave or use your horn to invite pedestrians across; this could be dangerous if another vehicle is
     approaching
   - be aware of pedestrians approaching from the side of the crossing.

A zebra crossing with a central island is two separate crossings (see pictures in Crossings (18 to 30)).
