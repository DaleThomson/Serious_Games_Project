Rule 22:

Pelican crossings. These are signal-controlled crossings operated by pedestrians. Push the control button to
activate the traffic signals. When the red figure shows, do not cross. When a steady green figure shows, check the
traffic has stopped then cross with care. When the green figure begins to flash you should not start to cross. If
you have already started you should have time to finish crossing safely.

Rule 23:

Puffin crossings differ from pelican crossings as the red and green figures are above the control box on your side
of the road and there is no flashing green figure phase. Press the button and wait for the green figure to show.

Rule 24:

When the road is congested, traffic on your side of the road may be forced to stop even though their lights are
green. Traffic may still be moving on the other side of the road, so press the button and wait for the signal to
cross.
