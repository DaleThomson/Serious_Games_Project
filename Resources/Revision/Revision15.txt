Rule 40:

When moving off the pavement onto the road, you should take special care. Before moving off, always look round and
make sure it's safe to join the traffic. Always try to use dropped kerbs when moving off the pavement, even if this
means travelling further to locate one. If you have to climb or descend a kerb, always approach it at right angles
and don't try to negotiate a kerb higher than the vehicle manufacturer's recommendations.

Rule 41:

You should take care when travelling on the road as you may be travelling more slowly than other traffic
(your machine is restricted to 8 mph (12 km/h) and may be less visible).

Rule 42:

When on the road, Class 3 vehicles should travel in the direction of the traffic. Class 2 users should always use
the pavement when it is available. When there is no pavement, you should use caution when on the road. Class 2
users should, where possible, travel in the direction of the traffic. If you are travelling at night when lights
MUST be used, you should travel in the direction of the traffic to avoid confusing other road users.
