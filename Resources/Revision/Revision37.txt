Rule 95:

Do not drink and drive as it will seriously affect your judgement and abilities.

In England and Wales you MUST NOT drive with a breath alcohol level higher than 35 microgrammes/100 millilitres of
breath or a blood alcohol level of more than 80 milligrammes/100 millilitres of blood.

In Scotland the legal limits are lower. You MUST NOT drive with a breath alcohol level higher than 22
microgrammes/100 millilitres of breath or a blood alcohol level of more than 50 milligrammes/100 millilitres of blood.

Alcohol will:

   - give a false sense of confidence
   - reduce co-ordination and slow down reactions
   - affect judgement of speed, distance and risk
   - reduce your driving ability, even if youâ€™re below the legal limit
   - take time to leave your body; you may be unfit to drive in the evening after drinking at lunchtime, or in the
     morning after drinking the previous evening.


The best solution is not to drink at all when planning to drive because any amount of alcohol affects your ability
to drive safely. If you are going to drink, arrange another means of transport.
