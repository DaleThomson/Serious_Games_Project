Rule 153:

Traffic-calming measures. On some roads there are features such as road humps, chicanes and narrowings which are
intended to slow you down. When you approach these features reduce your speed. Allow cyclists and motorcyclists
room to pass through them. Maintain a reduced speed along the whole of the stretch of road within the calming
measures. Give way to oncoming road users if directed to do so by signs. You should not overtake other moving road
users while in these areas.

Rule 154:

Take extra care on country roads and reduce your speed at approaches to bends, which can be sharper than they
appear, and at junctions and turnings, which may be partially hidden. Be prepared for pedestrians, horse riders,
cyclists, slow-moving farm vehicles or mud on the road surface. Make sure you can stop within the distance you can
see to be clear. You should also reduce your speed where country roads enter villages.

Rule 155:

Single-track roads. These are only wide enough for one vehicle. They may have special passing places. If you see a
vehicle coming towards you, or the driver behind wants to overtake, pull into a passing place on your left, or wait
opposite a passing place on your right. Give way to vehicles coming uphill whenever you can. If necessary, reverse
until you reach a passing place to let the other vehicle pass. Slow down when passing pedestrians, cyclists and
horse riders.
