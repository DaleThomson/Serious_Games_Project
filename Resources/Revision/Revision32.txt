Rule 84:

It is also advisable to wear eye protectors, which MUST comply with the Regulations. Scratched or poorly fitting
eye protectors can limit your view when riding, particularly in bright sunshine and the hours of darkness. Consider
wearing ear protection. Strong boots, gloves and suitable clothing may help to protect you if you are involved in a
collision.
