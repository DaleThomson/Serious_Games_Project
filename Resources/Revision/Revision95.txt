Rule 216:

Older drivers. Their reactions may be slower than other drivers. Make allowance for this.

Rule 217:

Learners and inexperienced drivers. They may not be so skilful at anticipating and responding to events. Be
particularly patient with learner drivers and young drivers. Drivers who have recently passed their test may display
a ‘new driver’ plate or sticker.

Rule 218:

Home Zones and Quiet Lanes. These are places where people could be using the whole of the road for a range of
activities such as children playing or for a community event. You should drive slowly and carefully and be prepared
to stop to allow people extra time to make space for you to pass them in safety.
