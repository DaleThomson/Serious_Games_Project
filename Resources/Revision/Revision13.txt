Rule 34:

Railway level crossings. You MUST NOT cross or pass a stop line when the red lights show, (including a red
pedestrian figure). Also do not cross if an alarm is sounding or the barriers are being lowered. The tone of the
alarm may change if another train is approaching. If there are no lights, alarms or barriers, stop, look both ways
and listen before crossing. A tactile surface comprising rounded bars running across the direction of pedestrian
travel may be installed on the footpath approaching a level crossing to warn visually impaired people of its
presence. The tactile surface should extend across the full width of the footway and should be located at an
appropriate distance from the barrier or projected line of the barrier.
