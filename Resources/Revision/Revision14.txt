Rule 37:

When you are on the road you should obey the guidance and rules for other vehicles; when on the pavement you should
follow the guidance and rules for pedestrians.

Rule 38:

Pavements are safer than roads and should be used when available. You should give pedestrians priority and show
consideration for other pavement users, particularly those with a hearing or visual impairment who may not be aware
that you are there.

Rule 39:

Powered wheelchairs and scooters MUST NOT travel faster than 4 mph (6 km/h) on pavements or in pedestrian areas.
You may need to reduce your speed to adjust to other pavement users who may not be able to move out of your way
quickly enough or where the pavement is too narrow.
