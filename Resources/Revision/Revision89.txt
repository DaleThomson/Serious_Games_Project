Rule 202:

Look carefully before you start reversing. You should:

   - use all your mirrors
   - check the 'blind spot' behind you (the part of the road you cannot see easily in the mirrors)
   - check there are no pedestrians (particularly children), cyclists, other road users or obstructions in the road
     behind you.

Reverse slowly while:

   - checking all around
   - looking mainly through the rear window
   - being aware that the front of your vehicle will swing out as you turn.

Get someone to guide you if you cannot see clearly.

Rule 203:

You MUST NOT reverse your vehicle further than necessary.
