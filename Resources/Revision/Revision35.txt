Rule 91:

Driving when you are tired greatly increases your risk of collision. To minimise this risk

   -make sure you are fit to drive. Do not begin a journey if you are tired. Get a good nightâ€™s sleep before
    embarking on a long journey
   -avoid undertaking long journeys between midnight and 6 am, when natural alertness is at a minimum
   -plan your journey to take sufficient breaks. A minimum break of at least 15 minutes after every two hours of
    driving is recommended
   -if you feel at all sleepy, stop in a safe place. Do not stop on the hard shoulder of a motorway
   -the most effective ways to counter sleepiness are to drink, for example, two cups of caffeinated coffee and to
    take a short nap (at least 15 minutes)
