Rule 282:

When passing the scene of an incident or crash do not be distracted or slow down unnecessarily (for example if an
incident is on the other side of a dual carriageway). This may cause a collision or traffic congestion, but see
Rule 283, below.

Rule 283:

If you are involved in a crash or stop to give assistance:

   - use your hazard warning lights to warn other traffic
   - ask drivers to switch off their engines and stop smoking
   - arrange for the emergency services to be called immediately with full details of the incident location and any
     casualties (on a motorway, use the emergency telephone which allows easy location by the emergency services. If
     you use a mobile phone, first make sure you have identified your location from the marker posts on the side of
     the hard shoulder)
   - move uninjured people away from the vehicles to safety; on a motorway this should, if possible, be well away
     from the traffic, the hard shoulder and the central reservation
   - do not move injured people from their vehicles unless they are in immediate danger from fire or explosion
   - do not remove a motorcyclist's helmet unless it is essential to do so
   - be prepared to give first aid
   - stay at the scene until emergency services arrive. If you are involved in any other medical emergency on the
     motorway you should contact the emergency services in the same way.
