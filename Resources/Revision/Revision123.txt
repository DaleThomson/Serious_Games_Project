Rule 279:

If anything falls from your vehicle (or any other vehicle) on to the road, stop and retrieve it only if it is safe
to do so.

Rule 280:

Motorways. On a motorway do not try to remove the obstruction yourself. Stop at the next emergency telephone and
call the Highways Agency or the police.

Rule 281:

Warning signs or flashing lights. If you see or hear emergency or incident support vehicles in the distance, be
aware there may be an incident ahead (see Rule 219). Police Officers and Highways Agency Traffic Officers may be
required to work in the carriageway, for example dealing with debris, collisions or conducting rolling road blocks.
Police officers will use rear-facing flashing red and blue lights and HA Traffic Officers will use rear-facing
flashing red and amber lights in these situations. Watch out for such signals, slow down and be prepared to stop.
You MUST follow any directions given by Police officers or Traffic officers as to whether you can safely pass the
incident or blockage.
