Rule 288:

When the 'Road Works Ahead' sign is displayed, you will need to be more watchful and look for additional signs
providing more specific instructions. Observe all signs - they are there for your safety and the safety of road
workers.

   - You MUST NOT exceed any temporary maximum speed limit.
   - Use your mirrors and get into the correct lane for your vehicle in good time and as signs direct.
   - Do not switch lanes to overtake queuing traffic.
   - Take extra care near cyclists and motorcyclists as they are vulnerable to skidding on grit, mud or other debris
     at road works.
   - Where lanes are restricted due to road works, merge in turn (see Rule 134).
   - Do not drive through an area marked off by traffic cones.
   - Watch out for traffic entering or leaving the works area, but do not be distracted by what is going on there.
     Concentrate on the road ahead, not the road works.
   - Bear in mind that the road ahead may be obstructed by the works or by slow moving or stationary traffic.
   - Keep a safe distance - there could be queues in front.
