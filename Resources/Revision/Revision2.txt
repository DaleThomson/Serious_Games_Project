Rule 4:

Young children should not be out alone on the pavement or road (see Rule 7). When taking children out, keep between
them and the traffic and hold their hands firmly. Strap very young children into push-chairs or use reins. When
pushing a young child in a buggy, do not push the buggy into the road when checking to see if it is clear to cross,
particularly from between parked vehicles.

Rule 5:

Organised walks. Large groups of people walking together should use a pavement if available; if one is not, they
should keep to the left. Look-outs should be positioned at the front and back of the group, and they should wear
fluorescent clothes in daylight and reflective clothes in the dark. At night, the look-out in front should show a
white light and the one at the back a red light. People on the outside of large groups should also carry lights and
wear reflective clothing.

Rule 6:

Motorways. Pedestrians MUST NOT be on motorways or slip roads except in an emergency (see Rule 271 and Rule 275).
