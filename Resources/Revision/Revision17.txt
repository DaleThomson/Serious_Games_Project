Rule 45:

All normal parking restrictions should be observed. Your vehicle should not be left unattended if it causes an
obstruction to other pedestrians - especially those in wheelchairs. Parking concessions provided under the Blue
Badge scheme (see Further reading) will apply to those vehicles displaying a valid badge.

Rule 46:

These vehicles MUST NOT be used on motorways (see Rule 253). They should not be used on unrestricted dual
carriageways where the speed limit exceeds 50 mph (80 km/h) but if they are used on these dual carriageways, they
MUST have a flashing amber beacon. A flashing amber beacon should be used on all other dual carriageways
(see Rule 220).

Rule 47:

Horse-drawn vehicles used on the highway should be operated and maintained in accordance with standards set out in
the Department for Transport's Code of Practice for Horse-Drawn Vehicles. This Code lays down the requirements for
a road driving assessment and includes a comprehensive list of safety checks to ensure that a carriage and its
fittings are safe and in good working order. The standards set out in the Road Driving Assessment may be required
to be met by a Local Authority if an operator wishes to obtain a local authority licence to operate a
passenger-carrying service.
