Rule 67:

You should:

   - look all around before moving away from the kerb, turning or manoeuvring, to make sure it is safe to do so.
     Give a clear signal to show other road users what you intend to do (download 'Signals to other road users')
   - look well ahead for obstructions in the road, such as drains, pot-holes and parked vehicles so that you do not

     being opened or pedestrians stepping into your path.
   - be aware of traffic coming up behind you.
   - take extra care near road humps, narrowings and other traffic calming features.
   - take care when overtaking (see Rules 162 to 169).

    - carry a passenger unless your cycle has been built or adapted to carry one
    - hold onto a moving vehicle or trailer
    - ride in a dangerous, careless or inconsiderate manner
    - ride when under the influence of drink or drugs, including medicine.
