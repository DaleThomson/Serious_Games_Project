Rule 73:

Pay particular attention to long vehicles which need a lot of room to manoeuvre at corners. Be aware that drivers
may not see you. They may have to move over to the right before turning left. Wait until they have completed the
manoeuvre because the rear wheels come very close to the kerb while turning. Do not be tempted to ride in the space
between them and the kerb.

Rule 74:

On the right. If you are turning right, check the traffic to ensure it is safe, then signal and move to the centre
of the road. Wait until there is a safe gap in the oncoming traffic and give a final look before completing the
turn. It may be safer to wait on the left until there is a safe gap or to dismount and push your cycle across the
road.

Rule 75:

Dual carriageways. Remember that traffic on most dual carriageways moves quickly. When crossing wait for a safe gap
and cross each carriageway in turn. Take extra care when crossing slip roads.
