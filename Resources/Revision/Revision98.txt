Rule 223:

Buses, coaches and trams. Give priority to these vehicles when you can do so safely, especially when they signal to
pull away from stops. Look out for people getting off a bus or tram and crossing the road.

Rule 224:

Electric vehicles. Be careful of electric vehicles such as milk floats and trams. Trams move quickly but silently and
cannot steer to avoid you.

Rule 225:

Vehicles with flashing amber beacons. These warn of a slow-moving or stationary vehicle
(such as a Traffic Officer vehicle, salt spreader, snow plough or recovery vehicle) or abnormal loads, so approach
with caution. On unrestricted dual carriageways, motor vehicles first used on or after 1 January 1947 with a maximum
speed of 25 mph (40 km/h) or less (such as tractors) MUST use a flashing amber beacon (also see Rule 220 above).
