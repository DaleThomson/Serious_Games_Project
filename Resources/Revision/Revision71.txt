Rule 161:

Mirrors. All mirrors should be used effectively throughout your journey. You should:

   - use your mirrors frequently so that you always know what is behind and to each side of you
   - use them in good time before you signal or change direction or speed
   - be aware that mirrors do not cover all areas and there will be blind spots.


You will need to look round and check.

Remember: Mirrors - Signal - Manoeuvre

Rule 162:

Before overtaking you should make sure:

   - the road is sufficiently clear ahead
   - road users are not beginning to overtake you
   - there is a suitable gap in front of the road user you plan to overtake.
