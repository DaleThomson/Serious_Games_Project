Rule 196:

Pelican crossings. These are signal-controlled crossings where flashing amber follows the red ‘Stop’ light. You MUST
stop when the red light shows. When the amber light is flashing, you MUST give way to any pedestrians on the crossing.
If the amber light is flashing and there are no pedestrians on the crossing, you may proceed with caution.
Laws ZPPPCRGD regs 23 & 26 & RTRA sect 25(5)

Rule 197:

Pelican crossings which go straight across the road are one crossing, even when there is a central island. You MUST
wait for pedestrians who are crossing from the other side of the island.
Laws ZPPPCRGD reg 26 & RTRA sect 25(5)

Rule 198:

Give way to anyone still crossing after the signal for vehicles has changed to green. This advice applies to all
crossings.

Rule 199:

Toucan, puffin and equestrian crossings. These are similar to pelican crossings, but there is no flashing amber phase;
the light sequence for traffic at these three crossings is the same as at traffic lights. If the signal-controlled
crossing is not working, proceed with extreme caution.
