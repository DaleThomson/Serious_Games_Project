Rule 289:

Take special care on motorways and other high-speed dual carriageways.

   - One or more lanes may be closed to traffic and a lower speed limit may apply.
   - Works vehicles that are slow moving or stationary with a large 'Keep Left' or 'Keep Right' sign on the back are
     sometimes used to close lanes for repairs, and a flashing light arrow may also be used to make the works
     vehicle more conspicuous from a distance and give earlier warning to drivers that they need to move over to the
     next lane.
   - Check mirrors, slow down and change lanes if necessary.
   - Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front (see Rule 126).

Rule 290:

Contraflow systems mean that you may be travelling in a narrower lane than normal and with no permanent barrier
between you and oncoming traffic. The hard shoulder may be used for traffic, but be aware that there may be
broken-down vehicles ahead of you. Keep a good distance from the vehicle ahead and observe any temporary speed
limits.
