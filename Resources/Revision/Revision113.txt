Rule 259:

Joining the motorway. When you join the motorway you will normally approach it from a road on the left
(a slip road) or from an adjoining motorway. You should

   -give priority to traffic already on the motorway
   -check the traffic on the motorway and match your speed to fit safely into the traffic flow in the left-hand
    lane
   -not cross solid white lines that separate lanes or use the hard shoulder
   -stay on the slip road if it continues as an extra lane on the motorway
   -remain in the left-hand lane long enough to adjust to the speed of traffic before considering overtaking.
