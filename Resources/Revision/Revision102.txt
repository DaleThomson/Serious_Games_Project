Rule 231:

Drive extremely carefully when the roads are icy. Avoid sudden actions as these could cause loss of control. You
should:

   - drive at a slow speed in as high a gear as possible; accelerate and brake very gently
   - drive particularly slowly on bends where loss of control is more likely. Brake progressively on the straight
     before you reach a bend. Having slowed down, steer smoothly round the bend, avoiding sudden actions
   - check your grip on the road surface when there is snow or ice by choosing a safe place to brake gently. If the
     steering feels unresponsive this may indicate ice and your vehicle losing its grip on the road. When travelling
     on ice, tyres make virtually no noise.

Rule 232:

High-sided vehicles are most affected by windy weather, but strong gusts can also blow a car, cyclist, motorcyclist
or horse rider off course. This can happen on open stretches of road exposed to strong crosswinds, or when passing
bridges or gaps in hedges.

Rule 233:

In very windy weather your vehicle may be affected by turbulence created by large vehicles. Motorcyclists are
particularly affected, so keep well back from them when they are overtaking a high-sided vehicle.
