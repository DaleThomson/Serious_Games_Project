Rule 169:

Do not hold up a long queue of traffic, especially if you are driving a large or slow-moving vehicle. Check your
mirrors frequently, and if necessary, pull in where it is safe and let traffic pass.

Rule 170:

Take extra care at junctions. You should

   - watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists, powered wheelchairs/mobility scooters and pedestrians as they are not
     always easy to see. Be aware that they may not have seen or heard you if you are approaching from behind
   - watch out for pedestrians crossing a road into which you are turning. If they have started to cross they have
     priority, so give way
   - watch out for long vehicles which may be turning at a junction ahead; they may have to use the whole width of the
     road to make the turn (see Rule 221)
   - watch out for horse riders who may take a different line on the road from that which you would expect
   - not assume, when waiting at a junction, that a vehicle coming from the right and signalling left will actually
     turn. Wait and make sure
   - look all around before emerging. Do not cross or join a road until there is a gap large enough for you to do so
     safely.
