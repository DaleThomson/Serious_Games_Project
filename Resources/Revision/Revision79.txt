Rule 177:

Green filter arrow. This indicates a filter lane only. Do not enter that lane unless you want to go in the direction
of the arrow. You may proceed in the direction of the green arrow when it, or the full green light shows. Give other
traffic, especially cyclists, time and room to move into the correct lane.

Rule 178:

Advanced stop lines. Some signal-controlled junctions have advanced stop lines to allow cycles to be positioned ahead
of other traffic. Motorists, including motorcyclists, MUST stop at the first white line reached if the lights are
amber or red and should avoid blocking the way or encroaching on the marked area at other times, e.g. if the junction
ahead is blocked. If your vehicle has proceeded over the first white line at the time that the signal goes red, you
MUST stop at the second white line, even if your vehicle is in the marked area. Allow cyclists time and space to move
off when the green signal shows.
