Rule 7 Continued:

D. If traffic is coming, let it pass. Look all around again and listen. Do not cross until there is a safe gap in
the traffic and you are certain that there is plenty of time. Remember, even if traffic is a long way off, it may
be approaching very quickly.

E. When it is safe, go straight across the road â€“ do not run. Keep looking and listening for traffic while you cross,
in case there is any traffic you did not see, or in case other traffic appears suddenly. Look out for cyclists and
motorcyclists travelling between lanes of traffic. Do not walk diagonally across the road.

Rule 8:

At a junction. When crossing the road, look out for traffic turning into the road, especially from behind you. If
you have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, you have priority and they should give way
(see Rule 170).

Rule 9:

Pedestrian Safety Barriers. Where there are barriers, cross the road only at the gaps provided for pedestrians. Do
not climb over the barriers or walk between them and the road.
