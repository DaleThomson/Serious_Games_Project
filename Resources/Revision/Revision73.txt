Rule 164:

Large vehicles. Overtaking these is more difficult. You should:

   - drop back. This will increase your ability to see ahead and should allow the driver of the large vehicle to see
     you in their mirrors. Getting too close to large vehicles, including agricultural vehicles such as a tractor with
     a trailer or other fixed equipment, will obscure your view of the road ahead and there may be another slow-moving
     vehicle in front
   - make sure that you have enough room to complete your overtaking manoeuvre before committing yourself. It takes
     longer to pass a large vehicle. If in doubt do not overtake
   - not assume you can follow a vehicle ahead which is overtaking a long vehicle. If a problem develops, they may
     abort overtaking and pull back in.

Rule 165:

You MUST NOT overtake:

   - if you would have to cross or straddle double white lines with a solid line nearest to you (but see Rule 129)
   - if you would have to enter an area designed to divide traffic, if it is surrounded by a solid white line
   - the nearest vehicle to a pedestrian crossing, especially when it has stopped to let pedestrians cross
   - if you would have to enter a lane reserved for buses, trams or cycles during its hours of operation
   - after a 'No Overtaking' sign and until you pass a sign cancelling the restriction.
