Rule 51:

At night. It is safer not to ride on the road at night or in poor visibility, but if you do, make sure you wear
reflective clothing and your horse has reflective bands above the fetlock joints. A light which shows white to the
front and red to the rear should be fitted, with a band, to the rider's right arm and/or leg/riding boot. If you
are leading a horse at night, carry a light in your right hand, showing white to the front and red to the rear,
and wear reflective clothing on both you and your horse. It is strongly recommended that a fluorescent/reflective
tail guard is also worn by your horse.

Rule 52:

Before you take a horse on to a road, you should:

   - ensure all tack fits well and is in good condition
   - make sure you can control the horse.

Always ride with other, less nervous horses if you think that your horse will be nervous of traffic. Never ride a
horse without both a saddle and bridle.
