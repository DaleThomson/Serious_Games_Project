Rule 84:

It is also advisable to wear eye protectors, which MUST comply with the Regulations. Scratched or poorly fitting
eye protectors can limit your view when riding, particularly in bright sunshine and the hours of darkness. Consider
wearing ear protection. Strong boots, gloves and suitable clothing may help to protect you if you are involved in a
collision.

Rule 86:

Daylight riding. Make yourself as visible as possible from the side as well as the front and rear. You could wear a
light or brightly coloured helmet and fluorescent clothing or strips. Dipped headlights, even in good daylight, may
also make you more conspicuous. However, be aware that other vehicle drivers may still not have seen you, or judged
your distance or speed correctly, especially at junctions.
