Rule 236:

You MUST NOT use front or rear fog lights unless visibility is seriously reduced (see Rule 226) as they dazzle other
road users and can obscure your brake lights. You MUST switch them off when visibility improves.
Law RVLR regs 25 & 27

Rule 237:

Keep your vehicle well ventilated to avoid drowsiness. Be aware that the road surface may become soft or if it rains
after a dry spell it may become slippery. These conditions could affect your steering and braking. If you are dazzled
by bright sunlight, slow down and if necessary, stop.

Rule 238:

You MUST NOT wait or park on yellow lines during the times of operation shown on nearby time plates
(or zone entry signs if in a Controlled Parking Zone) – download ‘Traffic signs’ and ‘Road markings’. Double yellow
lines indicate a prohibition of waiting at any time even if there are no upright signs. You MUST NOT wait or park, or
stop to set down and pick up passengers, on school entrance markings when upright signs indicate a prohibition of
stopping.
