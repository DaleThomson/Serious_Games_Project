Rule 230:

When driving in icy or snowy weather

   -drive with care, even if the roads have been treated
   -keep well back from the road user in front as stopping distances can be ten times greater than on dry roads
   -take care when overtaking vehicles spreading salt or other de-icer, particularly if you are riding a motorcycle or
    cycle
   -watch out for snowploughs which may throw out snow on either side. Do not overtake them unless the lane you
    intend to use has been cleared
   -be prepared for the road conditions to change over relatively short distances
   -listen to travel bulletins and take note of variable message signs that may provide information about weather, 
    road and traffic conditions ahead.
