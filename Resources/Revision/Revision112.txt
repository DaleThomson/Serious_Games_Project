Rule 254:

Traffic on motorways usually travels faster than on other roads, so you have less time to react. It is especially
important to use your mirrors earlier and look much further ahead than you would on other roads.

Rule 255:

Motorway signals are used to warn you of a danger ahead. For example, there may be an incident, fog, a spillage or
road workers on the carriageway which you may not immediately be able to see.

Rule 256:

Signals situated on the central reservation apply to all lanes. On very busy stretches, signals may be overhead
with a separate signal for each lane.

Rule 257:

Amber flashing lights. These warn of a hazard ahead. The signal may show a temporary maximum speed limit, lanes that
are closed or a message such as ‘Fog’. Adjust your speed and look out for the danger until you pass a signal which
is not flashing or one that gives the ‘All clear’ sign and you are sure it is safe to increase your speed.
