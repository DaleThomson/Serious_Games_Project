Rule 293:

Controlled Crossings. Most crossings have traffic light signals with a steady amber light, twin flashing red stop
lights and an audible alarm for pedestrians. They may have full, half or no barriers.

   - You MUST always obey the flashing red stop lights.
   - You MUST stop behind the white line across the road.
   - Keep going if you have already crossed the white line when the amber light comes on.
   - Do not reverse onto or over a controlled crossing.
   - You MUST wait if a train goes by and the red lights continue to flash. This means another train will be passing
     soon.
   - Only cross when the lights go off and barriers open.
   - Never zig-zag around half-barriers, they lower automatically because a train is approaching.
   - At crossings where there are no barriers, a train is approaching when the lights show.
