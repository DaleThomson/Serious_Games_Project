Rule 234:

Before entering fog check your mirrors then slow down. If the word 'Fog' is shown on a roadside signal but the road
is clear, be prepared for a bank of fog or drifting patchy fog ahead. Even if it seems to be clearing, you can
suddenly find yourself in thick fog.

Rule 235:

When driving in fog you should:

   - use your lights as required (see Rule 226)
   - keep a safe distance behind the vehicle in front. Rear lights can give a false sense of security
   - be able to pull up well within the distance you can see clearly. This is particularly important on motorways and
     dual carriageways, as vehicles are travelling faster
   - use your windscreen wipers and demisters
   - beware of other drivers not using headlights
   - not accelerate to get away from a vehicle which is too close behind you
   - check your mirrors before you slow down. Then use your brakes so that your brake lights warn drivers behind you
     that you are slowing down
   - stop in the correct position at a junction with limited visibility and listen for traffic. When you are sure it
     is safe to emerge, do so positively and do not hesitate in a position that puts you directly in the path of
     approaching vehicles.
