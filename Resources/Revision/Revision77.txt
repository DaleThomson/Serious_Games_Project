Rule 173:

Dual carriageways. When crossing or turning right, first assess whether the central reservation is deep enough to
protect the full length of your vehicle.

   -If it is, then you should treat each half of the carriageway as a separate road. Wait in the central reservation
    until there is a safe gap in the traffic on the second half of the road.
   -If the central reservation is too shallow for the length of your vehicle, wait until you can cross both
    carriageways in one go.
