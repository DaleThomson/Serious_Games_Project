Rule 174:

Box junctions. These have criss-cross yellow lines painted on the road. You MUST NOT enter the box until your exit
road or lane is clear. However, you may enter the box and wait when you want to turn right, and are only stopped from 
doing so by oncoming traffic, or by other vehicles waiting to turn right. At signalled roundabouts you MUST NOT enter 
the box unless you can cross over it completely without stopping.
Law TSRGD regs 10(1) & 29(2)

Rule 175:

You MUST stop behind the white 'Stop' line across your side of the road unless the light is green. If the amber 
light appears you may go on only if you have already crossed the stop line or are so close to it that to stop might 
cause a collision.
Laws RTA 1988 sect 36 & TSRGD regs 10 & 36

Rule 176:

You MUST NOT move forward over the white line when the red light is showing. Only go forward when the traffic lights
are green if there is room for you to clear the junction safely or you are taking up a position to turn right. If the 
traffic lights are not working, treat the situation as you would an unmarked junction and proceed with great care.
