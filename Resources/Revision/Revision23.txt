Rule 60:

At night your cycle MUST have white front and red rear lights lit. It MUST also be fitted with a red rear reflector
(and amber pedal reflectors, if manufactured after 1/10/85). White front reflectors and spoke reflectors will also
help you to be seen. Flashing lights are permitted but it is recommended that cyclists who are riding in areas
without street lighting use a steady front lamp.

Rule 61:

Cycle Routes and Other Facilities. Use cycle routes, advanced stop lines, cycle boxes and toucan crossings unless at
the time it is unsafe to do so. Use of these facilities is not compulsory and will depend on your experience and
skills, but they can make your journey safer.

Rule 62:

Cycle Tracks. These are normally located away from the road, but may occasionally be found alongside footpaths or
pavements. Cyclists and pedestrians may be segregated or they may share the same space (unsegregated). When using
segregated tracks you MUST keep to the side intended for cyclists as the pedestrian side remains a pavement or
footpath. Take care when passing pedestrians, especially children, older or disabled people, and allow them plenty
of room. Always be prepared to slow down and stop if necessary. Take care near road junctions as you may have
difficulty seeing other road users, who might not notice you.
