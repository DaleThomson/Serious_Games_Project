Rule 28:

'Staggered' pelican or puffin crossings. When the crossings on each side of the central refuge are not in line they
are two separate crossings. On reaching the central island, press the button again and wait for a steady green
figure.

Rule 29:

Crossings controlled by an authorised person. Do not cross the road unless you are signalled to do so by a police
officer, traffic warden or school crossing patrol. Always cross in front of them.

Rule 30:

Where there are no controlled crossing points available it is advisable to cross where there is an island in the
middle of the road. Use the Green Cross Code (see Rule 7) to cross to the island and then stop and use it again to
cross the second half of the road.
