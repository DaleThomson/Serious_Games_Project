Rule 227:

In wet weather, stopping distances will be at least double those required for stopping on dry roads. This is because 
your tyres have less grip on the road. In wet weather:

   - you should keep well back from the vehicle in front. This will increase your ability to see and plan ahead
   - if the steering becomes unresponsive, it probably means that water is preventing the tyres from gripping the 
     road. Ease off the accelerator and slow down gradually
   - the rain and spray from vehicles may make it difficult to see and be seen
   - be aware of the dangers of spilt diesel that will make the surface very slippery.
   - take extra care around pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders.

Rule 228:

In winter check the local weather forecast for warnings of icy or snowy weather. DO NOT drive in these conditions
unless your journey is essential. If it is, take great care and allow more time for your journey. Take an emergency
kit of de-icer and ice scraper, torch, warm clothing and boots, first aid kit, jump leads and a shovel, together with
a warm drink and emergency food in case you get stuck or your vehicle breaks down.
