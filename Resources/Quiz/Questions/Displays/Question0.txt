Welcome to the mock driving theory test, here you will be asked 50 questions. A grade of 86% or 43/50 is required
to pass the test. At any point during the test you may exit either to the menu, or the software entirely.
There is no punishment for failing the test, if you feel you are not ready for the test then you can return to
the main menu and access the revision section and read up on the highway code.
